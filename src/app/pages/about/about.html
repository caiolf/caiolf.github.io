  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm a Web Developer graduate from the University of UNIP Brazil. I
    currently work at Components Engine â€“ Italy as an Angular Software
    Developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in the intersection of Development and Design. I believe that
    technology is a powerful tool for artistic expression, and that creativity
    plays a key role in shaping the digital experiences we build.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, I've been learning about AI and building modern, responsive
    applications using the most advanced Angular techniques available in the
    market (Angular 20).
